# InShort - AI-Powered Bill Summaries

InShort provides personalized AI summaries of U.S. bills using Groq's LLM API. This project scrapes bill data from Congress.gov and generates tailored summaries for different user profiles.

## Prerequisites

1. **Congress.gov API Key**: Get a free API key from [Congress.gov API](https://api.congress.gov/)
   - Visit https://api.congress.gov/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Generate your API key
   - Already there in google docs file

2. **Groq API Key**: Get an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Visit https://console.groq.com/
   - Sign up for an account
   - Generate your API key
   - Already there in google docs file

3. **Python Dependencies**: Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

- `full_bill_scraper.py` - Scrapes comprehensive bill data from Congress.gov
- `inshort_summarizer.py` - Generates personalized AI summaries using Groq
- `inshort_bills.json` - Bill data (generated by scraper)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Set up API Keys

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Set Congress.gov API key
export CONGRESS_API_KEY="your_congress_api_key_here"

# Set Groq API key
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
```

### Step 2: Scrape Bill Data

Run the bill scraper to collect comprehensive bill data:

```bash
python3 full_bill_scraper.py
```

This will:
- Fetch the most recent 100 bills from Congress.gov
- Collect full details including sponsors, actions, amendments, text, and more
- Save the data to `inshort_bills.json`

### Step 3: Generate AI Summaries

Run the AI summarizer to create personalized summaries:

```bash
python3 inshort_summarizer.py
```

This will:
- Load the bill data from `inshort_bills.json`
- Generate personalized summaries for different user profiles
- Show how the same bill affects different users differently

## Detailed Usage

### Bill Scraper Options

The `full_bill_scraper.py` script collects comprehensive bill data:

```bash
# Basic usage (collects 100 bills)
python3 full_bill_scraper.py

# The script automatically:
# - Fetches bills from the 119th Congress
# - Collects full details for each bill
# - Saves data to inshort_bills.json
```

### AI Summarizer Features

The `inshort_summarizer.py` script generates personalized summaries for:

1. **Sarah (25yo, Texas, recent graduate)** - Focus on student loans, job market, housing
2. **Mike (45yo, California, small business owner)** - Focus on business regulations, taxes, healthcare
3. **Lisa (62yo, Florida, retired teacher)** - Focus on Medicare, Social Security, education
4. **David (35yo, New York, tech worker)** - Focus on tech regulations, privacy, immigration

Each summary is tailored to show how the bill specifically impacts that user's situation.

## Example Output

### Bill Scraper Output
```
Fetching bills 0 to 10...
  Getting full details for HR1234 (119th Congress)...
    Title: Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act...
    âœ“ Successfully collected full details (1/100)
  
Total bills with full details collected: 100
Saved 100 bills with full details to inshort_bills.json
```

### AI Summarizer Output
```
ðŸ“± Sarah (25yo, Texas, recent graduate)
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“‹ Bill 1: Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act
ðŸ’¡ This bill directly impacts your ability to buy a home! It protects your personal 
financial information when applying for mortgages, preventing lenders from sharing 
your sensitive data without permission. As a recent graduate looking to buy your 
first home, this gives you more control over your financial privacy and could 
help you avoid predatory lending practices.

ðŸ“‹ Bill 2: Student Loan Forgiveness Act
ðŸ’¡ Great news for your student debt! This bill expands loan forgiveness programs 
for recent graduates working in public service or low-income areas. You could 
qualify for partial or full forgiveness of your student loans if you work in 
education, healthcare, or government for 10 years.
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```bash
# Congress.gov API
CONGRESS_API_KEY=your_congress_api_key

# Groq API
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### Customizing User Profiles

Edit the user profiles in `inshort_summarizer.py` to match your target audience:

```python
USER_PROFILES = [
    {
        "name": "Your Custom Profile",
        "age": 30,
        "location": "Your State",
        "occupation": "Your Job",
        "interests": ["relevant", "topics", "here"]
    }
]
```

## API Rate Limits

- **Congress.gov**: 1,000 requests per hour (free tier)
- **Groq**: Varies by plan, typically 100+ requests per minute

The scripts include rate limiting to stay within these limits.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API Keys**: Make sure your API keys are correct and active
2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Wait before making more requests
3. **Python Command Not Found**: Use `python3` instead of `python`
4. **Environment Variable Not Set**: Export your API keys in the terminal

### Error Messages

- `Invalid API Key`: Check your API key is correct
- `Rate Limit Exceeded`: Wait before retrying
- `File Not Found`: Make sure `inshort_bills.json` exists

## Data Privacy

- API keys are stored as environment variables (not in code)
- Bill data is public information from Congress.gov
- User profiles are fictional examples for demonstration
