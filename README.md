# InShort - AI-Powered Bill Summaries

InShort provides personalized AI summaries of U.S. bills using Groq's LLM API. This project scrapes bill data from Congress.gov and generates tailored summaries for different user profiles.

## Prerequisites

1. **Congress.gov API Key**: Get a free API key from [Congress.gov API](https://api.congress.gov/)
   - Visit https://api.congress.gov/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Generate your API key
   - Already there in google docs file

2. **Groq API Key**: Get an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Visit https://console.groq.com/
   - Sign up for an account
   - Generate your API key
   - Already there in google docs file

3. **Python Dependencies**: Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

- `full_bill_scraper.py` - Scrapes comprehensive bill data from Congress.gov
- `inshort_summarizer.py` - Generates personalized AI summaries using Groq
- `inshort_bills.json` - Bill data (generated by scraper)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Set up API Keys

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Set Congress.gov API key
export CONGRESS_API_KEY="your_congress_api_key_here"

# Set Groq API key
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
```

### Step 2: Scrape Bill Data

Run the bill scraper to collect comprehensive bill data:

```bash
python3 full_bill_scraper.py
```

This will:
- Fetch the most recent 100 bills from Congress.gov
- Collect full details including sponsors, actions, amendments, text, and more
- Save the data to `inshort_bills.json`

### Step 3: Generate AI Summaries

Run the AI summarizer to create personalized summaries:

```bash
python3 inshort_summarizer.py
```

This will:
- Load the bill data from `inshort_bills.json`
- Generate personalized summaries for different user profiles
- Show how the same bill affects different users differently

## Detailed Usage

### Bill Scraper Options

The `full_bill_scraper.py` script collects comprehensive bill data:

```bash
# Basic usage (collects 100 bills)
python3 full_bill_scraper.py

# The script automatically:
# - Fetches bills from the 119th Congress
# - Collects full details for each bill
# - Saves data to inshort_bills.json
```

### AI Summarizer Features

The `inshort_summarizer.py` script generates personalized summaries for:

1. **Sarah (25yo, Texas, recent graduate)** - Focus on student loans, job market, housing
2. **Mike (45yo, California, small business owner)** - Focus on business regulations, taxes, healthcare
3. **Lisa (62yo, Florida, retired teacher)** - Focus on Medicare, Social Security, education
4. **David (35yo, New York, tech worker)** - Focus on tech regulations, privacy, immigration

Each summary is tailored to show how the bill specifically impacts that user's situation.

## Example Output

### Bill Scraper Output
```
Fetching bills 0 to 10...
  Getting full details for HR1234 (119th Congress)...
    Title: Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act...
    ‚úì Successfully collected full details (1/100)
  
Total bills with full details collected: 100
Saved 100 bills with full details to inshort_bills.json
```

### AI Summarizer Output
```
üì± Sarah (25yo, Texas, recent graduate)
--------------------------------------------------

üìã Bill 1: Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act
üí° This bill directly impacts your ability to buy a home! It protects your personal 
financial information when applying for mortgages, preventing lenders from sharing 
your sensitive data without permission. As a recent graduate looking to buy your 
first home, this gives you more control over your financial privacy and could 
help you avoid predatory lending practices.

üìã Bill 2: Student Loan Forgiveness Act
üí° Great news for your student debt! This bill expands loan forgiveness programs 
for recent graduates working in public service or low-income areas. You could 
qualify for partial or full forgiveness of your student loans if you work in 
education, healthcare, or government for 10 years.
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```bash
# Congress.gov API
CONGRESS_API_KEY=your_congress_api_key

# Groq API
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### Customizing User Profiles

Edit the user profiles in `inshort_summarizer.py` to match your target audience:

```python
USER_PROFILES = [
    {
        "name": "Your Custom Profile",
        "age": 30,
        "location": "Your State",
        "occupation": "Your Job",
        "interests": ["relevant", "topics", "here"]
    }
]
```

## API Rate Limits

- **Congress.gov**: 1,000 requests per hour (free tier)
- **Groq**: Varies by plan, typically 100+ requests per minute

The scripts include rate limiting to stay within these limits.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid API Keys**: Make sure your API keys are correct and active
2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Wait before making more requests
3. **Python Command Not Found**: Use `python3` instead of `python`
4. **Environment Variable Not Set**: Export your API keys in the terminal

### Error Messages

- `Invalid API Key`: Check your API key is correct
- `Rate Limit Exceeded`: Wait before retrying
- `File Not Found`: Make sure `inshort_bills.json` exists

## Data Privacy

- API keys are stored as environment variables (not in code)
- Bill data is public information from Congress.gov
- User profiles are fictional examples for demonstration

## Legal Notice

This tool is for educational and research purposes. Please respect the Congress.gov and Groq API terms of service and rate limits. The bill data is provided by the United States Congress and is in the public domain.

## RAG System and Bill Recommender

InShort now includes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that uses Pinecone for vector storage and Groq for generating summaries.

### Prerequisites for RAG System

1. **Pinecone API Key**: Get a free API key from [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
   - Visit https://www.pinecone.io/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Generate your API key

2. **OpenAI API Key**: For generating embeddings
   - Visit https://platform.openai.com/
   - Generate your API key

Set your additional API keys:

```bash
# Set Pinecone API key
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key_here"

# Set OpenAI API key (for embeddings)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

### Step 4: Store Bills in Vector Database

First, update the bills in Pinecone with summaries:

```bash
python3 upsert_bills.py
```

This will:
- Read the bill data from `inshort_bills.json`
- Extract summaries from the bill data
- Generate embeddings for each bill
- Store everything in Pinecone with metadata including summaries

### Step 5: Test Bill Recommender

Test the bill recommender with Groq integration:

```bash
python3 test_bill_recommender.py
```

Or run the recommender directly:

```bash
python3 RAG/billRecommender.py
```

### Bill Recommender Features

The updated `BillRecommender` class provides:

1. **Vector Search**: Uses embeddings to find relevant bills based on user interests
2. **Groq Integration**: Automatically generates summaries using Groq when not available in metadata
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Returns bills ranked by relevance to user interests
4. **Comprehensive Metadata**: Includes bill title, sponsor, congress, and summary

### Example RAG Output

```
Based on your interests, we recommend the following bills:

#1 - HR1234 (Score: 0.856)
üìã Title: Student Loan Forgiveness Act
üë§ Sponsor: Sponsored by John Smith
üèõÔ∏è Congress: 119
üìñ Summary: This bill expands student loan forgiveness programs for graduates working in public service. It could save you thousands of dollars on your student debt if you work in education, healthcare, or government for 10 years. This affects you.
--------------------------------------------------
```

### RAG System Architecture

- **Vector Storage**: Pinecone stores bill embeddings and metadata
- **Embedding Generation**: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- **Summary Generation**: Groq's llama3-8b-8192 model
- **Retrieval**: Semantic search based on user interests
- **Generation**: AI-generated summaries when not available in metadata

### Customizing the RAG System

You can modify the `BillRecommender` class to:

1. **Change Search Parameters**: Adjust `top_k` and `min_score` thresholds
2. **Customize Summaries**: Modify the Groq prompt for different summary styles
3. **Add User Profiles**: Integrate with the personalized summarizer
4. **Filter Results**: Add additional filtering based on bill status, date, etc.
